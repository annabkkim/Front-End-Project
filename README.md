# Front-End-Project

Project is called "Sweet Treats"

It's a dessert-kit subscription service for customers wanting to make healthy yet delicious desserts at home. Comes with all the ingredients and instructions on how to bake the desserts. This project was inspired by all the delicious baked goods I've seen people post on their social media and how many people would enjoy this subscription service!

My project includes the following:
-flex box
-media queries
-css grid
